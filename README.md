# basic_calculator
Simple calculator build using Python.


Just for fun, I've decided to develope the most basic calculator using Python. 
This build only took 20 minutes in total and was very enjoyable, coding in Python is very fun.

How to run:
1. Download the necessary included files in "<> Code"
2. Open the files using PyCharm.
3. Run the code and test it out!
